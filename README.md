**# Predicting Blood Glucose Fluctuations Using Machine Learning**

## üìå Project Overview

This project leverages **machine learning** to model and predict **blood glucose responses** based on dietary inputs, insulin activity, and lifestyle factors. Motivated by personal health concerns and growing public awareness around **Type 2 Diabetes**, the goal is to understand how **daily food choices** influence glucose spikes.

## üß† Motivation

Early diabetes detection is crucial but challenging due to **manual diagnosis limitations**. Additionally, monitoring dietary sugar intake is vital for diabetes management. The project addresses:
Predicting diabetes based on medical features.
Recognizing foods via speech or images to estimate sugar content.

**Dataset**
Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (UCI Repository):768 samples, 8 features (Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age).
Binary target: Outcome (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic).
Challenges: Zero values in features (e.g., Glucose, BMI) require preprocessing.

## üî¨ Project Details

- **Data Sources**: Public datasets (nutrition, glucose monitoring, insulin levels)
- **Diabetes Prediction**:
The dataset is primarily used to develop and test machine learning models for predicting whether an individual has diabetes based on medical features such as Glucose, BMI, Age, Pregnancies, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, and DiabetesPedigreeFunction. The binary target (Outcome: 0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic) makes it ideal for binary classification tasks.

### Medical Research:
It provides insights into risk factors for diabetes, particularly among the Pima Indian population, which has a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Researchers use it to study correlations between features (e.g., high glucose or BMI) and diabetes onset.
### Educational Tool:
The dataset is a staple in machine learning courses and tutorials due to its simplicity, small size (768 samples, 8 features), and real-world relevance. It‚Äôs used to teach concepts like data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature engineering.
### Algorithm Benchmarking:
Researchers and practitioners use it to compare the performance of different algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks) or techniques (e.g., feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning) on a standard dataset.
### Data Preprocessing Practice:
The dataset contains challenges like zero values in biologically implausible features (e.g., Glucose, BMI), making it a good case study for handling missing or invalid data through imputation or other techniques.

### Applications:
Building predictive models for early diabetes detection.
Developing healthcare tools for risk assessment.
Studying feature importance in diabetes risk (e.g., glucose levels or family history).
Testing new machine learning algorithms or preprocessing methods.

- **Technologies Used**:
  - Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
  - Jupyter Notebook
- **Models Built**:
  - Linear Regression for glucose prediction
  - Random Forest and XGBoost for feature importance and better prediction accuracy
- **Target Output**:
  - Predict post-meal glucose levels
  - Visualize insulin responses
  - Track risk zones

## üìà Key Outcomes

Diabetes Prediction:Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas.
Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets (train_test_split with stratify).
Trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel (sklearn.svm.SVC).

Proposed Food Recognition:Speech Recognition: Use speech_recognition or fine-tuned Wav2Vec (PyTorch) to identify foods from voice input (e.g., ‚Äúapple‚Äù).
Image Recognition: Use ResNet50 (PyTorch) fine-tuned on a food dataset (e.g., Food-101) to identify foods from images.
Sugar Estimation: Query USDA FoodData Central API or a local database to estimate sugar content.
Integration: Add estimated sugar intake as a feature to enhance the diabetes prediction model.

## ‚úÖ Technologies

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, speech_recognition, opencv-python, tensorflow, torch, torchvision.
Machine Learning: SVM (sklearn), potential for lazypredict to compare models.
Deep Learning: TensorFlow/PyTorch for speech/image recognition.
APIs: USDA FoodData Central for nutritional data.
