**# Predicting Blood Glucose Fluctuations Using Machine Learning**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project leverages **machine learning** to model and predict **blood glucose responses** based on dietary inputs, insulin activity, and lifestyle factors. Motivated by personal health concerns and growing public awareness around **Type 2 Diabetes**, the goal is to understand how **daily food choices** influence glucose spikes.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

After listening to *The Diary of a CEO* podcast episode on the food industry and hidden sugars, I became alarmed by how little awareness we have about our body's glucose and insulin responses. Though not from the healthcare industry, I used my technical background in data and ML to explore this critical issue.

## ðŸ”¬ Project Details

- **Data Sources**: Public datasets (nutrition, glucose monitoring, insulin levels)
- **Technologies Used**:
  - Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
  - Jupyter Notebook
- **Models Built**:
  - Linear Regression for glucose prediction
  - Random Forest and XGBoost for feature importance and better prediction accuracy
- **Target Output**:
  - Predict post-meal glucose levels
  - Visualize insulin responses
  - Track risk zones

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Outcomes

- Demonstrated **how food composition affects glucose spikes**
- Identified **high-risk combinations** using model insights
- Shared visualizations to raise awareness about **diet-related glucose changes**
- Inspired non-technical audiences to think about **preventive health**

## âœ… Results

- Achieved up to **85% prediction accuracy**
- Created clear **plots showing glucose fluctuations** with food inputs
- Used **feature importance scores** to highlight which nutrients impact glucose most

## ðŸ“Ž How to Use

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook  
3. Input your own food data (or use the sample)  
4. View predicted glucose response and insights  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/glucose-predictor.git
